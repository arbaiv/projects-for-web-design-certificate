1st of all find the person that I am gonna write a portfolio on
Then I have to include this informations in my web page (similar to this page link: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx)

1. The whole page should be in a div element that has an id="main" attribute

2. then a big title of that person and the element that will contain the title element should have an id="title"

3. there should be a big image of that guy in a div element with id="img-div" 

4. in that id="img-div" element, insert a figure element and put the picture of the person inside of figure in an img empty element and that empty element should have an id tag of id="image"

5. in that id="img-div" element, at the end of that picture there should be a figcaption element about the picture and figcaption should have an id="img-caption"

6. there should be an element that holds information about that person and it should have an id="tribute-info"

7. there should be an A element that leads outside of the page to another page that contains more information about that guy

8. The image should be responsive and shouldn't exceed its normal size

9. The image should be centered within its parent element
